  "content": "Grade 7\nIn grade 7, instructional time should focus on four critical areas: (1) developing understanding of and applying proportional \nrelationships; (2) developing understanding of operations with rational numbers and working with expressions and linear  \nequations; (3) solving problems involving scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and working with two- and \nthree-dimensional shapes to solve problems involving area, surface area, and volume; and (4) drawing inferences about  \npopulations based on samples.\n(1) Students extend their understanding of ratios and develop understanding of proportionality to solve single- and multi-step \nproblems. Students use their understanding of ratios and proportionality to solve a wide variety of percent problems,  \nincluding those involving discounts, interest, taxes, tips, and percent increase or decrease. Students solve problems about \nscale drawings by relating corresponding lengths between the objects or by using the fact that relationships of lengths \nwithin an object are preserved in similar objects. Students graph proportional relationships and understand the unit rate \ninformally as a measure of the steepness of the related line, called the slope. They distinguish proportional relationships \nfrom other relationships.\n(2) Students develop a uni\ufb01ed understanding of number, recognizing fractions, decimals (that have a \ufb01nite or a repeating deci-\nmal representation), and percents as different representations of rational numbers. Students extend addition, subtraction, \nmultiplication, and division to all rational numbers, maintaining the properties of operations and the relationships between \naddition and subtraction, and multiplication and division. By applying these properties, and by viewing negative numbers \nin terms of everyday contexts (e.g., amounts owed or temperatures below zero), students explain and interpret the rules for \nadding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing with negative numbers. They use the arithmetic of rational numbers as they \nformulate expressions and equations in one variable and use these equations to solve problems. \n(3) Students continue their work with area from grade 6, solving problems involving the area and circumference of a circle and \nsurface area of three-dimensional objects. In preparation for work on congruence and similarity in grade 8 they reason \nabout relationships among two-dimensional \ufb01gures using scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and they \ngain familiarity with the relationships between angles formed by intersecting lines. Students work with three-dimensional \n\ufb01gures, relating them to two-dimensional \ufb01gures by examining cross-sections. They solve real-world and mathematical  \nproblems involving area, surface area, and volume of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of triangles,  \nquadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right prisms.\n(4) Students build on their previous work with single data distributions to compare two data distributions and address  \nquestions about differences between populations. They begin informal work with random sampling to generate data sets \nand learn about the importance of representative samples for drawing inferences. \n46 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 7\n\n \nGrade 7 Overview\nRatios and Proportional Relationships\n\ue001 \nAnalyze proportional relationships and use them to solve  \nreal-world and mathematical problems.\nThe Number System\n\ue001 \nApply and extend previous understandings of operations  \nwith fractions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide  \nrational numbers.\nExpressions and Equations\n\ue001 \nUse properties of operations to generate equivalent  \nexpressions.\n\ue001 \nSolve real-life and mathematical problems using numerical  \nand algebraic expressions and equations.\nGeometry\n\ue001 \nDraw, construct and describe geometrical \ufb01gures and describe  \nthe relationships between them.\n\ue001 \nSolve real-life and mathematical problems involving angle  \nmeasure, area, surface area, and volume.\nStatistics and Probability\n\ue001 \nUse random sampling to draw inferences about a population.\n\ue001 \nDraw informal comparative inferences about two populations.\n\ue001 \nInvestigate chance processes and develop, use, and evaluate probability models.\nMathematical Practices\n1.

Model with mathematics.\n5.  Use appropriate tools strategically.\n6.  Attend to precision.\n7.  Look for and make use of structure.\n8.  Look for and express regularity in repeated \nreasoning.\nGrade 7\nK\u20138 Standards | 47\n\n7\nGrade 7\nRatios and Proportional Relationships \n7.RP\nAnalyze proportional relationships and use them to solve real-world and mathematical problems.\n1.  Compute unit rates associated with ratios of fractions, including ratios of lengths, areas and other quantities measured in \nlike or different units. For example, if a person walks 1/2 mile in each 1/4 hour, compute the unit rate as the complex  \nfraction \u00bd/\u00bc miles per hour, equivalently 2 miles per hour.\n2.  Recognize and represent proportional relationships between quantities.\na.  Decide whether two quantities are in a proportional relationship, e.g., by testing for equivalent ratios in a table or  \ngraphing on a coordinate plane and observing whether the graph is a straight line through the origin.\nb.  Identify the constant of proportionality (unit rate) in tables, graphs, equations, diagrams, and verbal descriptions of \nproportional relationships.\nc.  Represent proportional relationships by equations. For example, if total cost t is proportional to the number n of items \npurchased at a constant price p, the relationship between the total cost and the number of items can be expressed  \nas t = pn.\nd.  Explain what a point (x, y) on the graph of a proportional relationship means in terms of the situation, with special  \nattention to the points (0, 0) and (1, r) where r is the unit rate.\n3.  Use proportional relationships to solve multistep ratio and percent problems. Examples: simple interest, tax, markups and \nmarkdowns, gratuities and commissions, fees, percent increase and decrease, percent error.\nThe Number System \n7.NS\nApply and extend previous understandings of operations with fractions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide \nrational numbers.\n1.  Apply and extend previous understandings of addition and subtraction to add and subtract rational numbers; represent  \naddition and subtraction on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram.\na.  Describe situations in which opposite quantities combine to make 0. For example, a hydrogen atom has 0 charge  \nbecause its two constituents are oppositely charged.\nb.  Understand p + q as the number located a distance |q| from p, in the positive or negative direction depending on \nwhether q is positive or negative. Show that a number and its opposite have a sum of 0 (are additive inverses).  \nInterpret sums of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.\nc.  Understand subtraction of rational numbers as adding the additive inverse, p \u2013 q = p + (\u2013q). Show that the distance \nbetween two rational numbers on the number line is the absolute value of their difference, and apply this principle in \nreal-world contexts.\nd.  Apply properties of operations as strategies to add and subtract rational numbers.\n2.  Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division and of fractions to multiply and divide rational \nnumbers.\na.  Understand that multiplication is extended from fractions to rational numbers by requiring that operations continue to \nsatisfy the properties of operations, particularly the distributive property, leading to products such as (\u20131)(\u20131) = 1 and \nthe rules for multiplying signed numbers. Interpret products of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.\n48 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 7\n\nGrade 7 7\nb.  Understand that integers can be divided, provided that the divisor is not zero, and every quotient of integers (with  \nnon-zero divisor) is a rational number. If p and q are integers, then \u2013(p/q) = (\u2013p)/q = p/(\u2013q). Interpret quotients of \nrational numbers by describing real-world contexts.\nc.  Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide rational numbers.\nd.  Convert a rational number to a decimal using long division; know that the decimal form of a rational number terminates \nin 0s or eventually repeats.\n3.  Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving the four operations with rational numbers.1\nExpressions and Equations \n7.EE\nUse properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions.\n1.  Apply properties of operations as strategies to add, subtract, factor, and expand linear expressions with rational coef\ufb01cients.\n2.  Understand that rewriting an expression in different forms in a problem context can shed light on the problem and how the \nquantities in it are related. For example, a + 0.05a = 1.05a means that \u201cincrease by 5%\u201d is the same as \u201cmultiply by 1.05.\u201d\nSolve real-life and mathematical problems using numerical and algebraic expressions and equations.\n3.  Solve multi-step real-life and mathematical problems posed with positive and negative rational numbers in any form (whole \nnumbers, fractions, and decimals), using tools strategically. Apply properties of operations to calculate with numbers in any \nform; convert between forms as appropriate; and assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and \nestimation strategies. For example: If a woman making $25 an hour gets a 10% raise, she will make an additional 1/10 of \nher salary an hour, or $2.50, for a new salary of $27.50. If you want to place a towel bar 9 3/4 inches long in the center of \na door that is 27 1/2 inches wide, you will need to place the bar about 9 inches from each edge; this estimate can be used \nas a check on the exact computation.\n4.  Use variables to represent quantities in a real-world or mathematical problem, and construct simple equations and  \ninequalities to solve problems by reasoning about the quantities.\na.  Solve word problems leading to equations of the form px + q = r and p(x + q) = r, where p, q, and r are speci\ufb01c rational \nnumbers. Solve equations of these forms \ufb02uently. Compare an algebraic solution to an arithmetic solution, identifying \nthe sequence of the operations used in each approach. For example, the perimeter of a rectangle is 54 cm. Its length  \nis 6 cm. What is its width?\nb. Solve word problems leading to inequalities of the form px + q > r or px + q < r, where p, q, and r are speci\ufb01c rational \nnumbers. Graph the solution set of the inequality and interpret it in the context of the problem. For example: As a \nsalesperson, you are paid $50 per week plus $3 per sale. This week you want your pay to be at least $100. Write an \ninequality for the number of sales you need to make, and describe the solutions.\nGeometry \n7.G\nDraw, construct, and describe geometrical \ufb01gures and describe the relationships between them.\n1.  Solve problems involving scale drawings of geometric \ufb01gures, including computing actual lengths and areas from a scale \ndrawing and reproducing a scale drawing at a different scale.\n1. Computations with rational numbers extend the rules for manipulating fractions to complex fractions.\nGrade 7\nK\u20138 Standards  | 49\n\n50 | K\u20138 Standards\n7\nGrade 7\n2.  Draw (freehand, with ruler and protractor, and with technology) geometric shapes with given conditions. Focus on construct-\ning triangles from three measures of angles or sides, noticing when the conditions determine a unique triangle, more than \none triangle, or no triangle.\n3.  Describe the two-dimensional \ufb01gures that result from slicing three-dimensional \ufb01gures, as in plane sections of right  \nrectangular prisms and right rectangular pyramids.\nSolve real-life and mathematical problems involving angle measure, area, surface area, and volume.\n4.  Know the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle and use them to solve problems; give an informal derivation of \nthe relationship between the circumference and area of a circle.\n5.  Use facts about supplementary, complementary, vertical, and adjacent angles in a multi-step problem to write and solve \nsimple equations for an unknown angle in a \ufb01gure.\n6.  Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, volume and surface area of two- and three-dimensional objects \ncomposed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right prisms.\nStatistics and Probability \n7.SP\nUse random sampling to draw inferences about a population.\n1.  Understand that statistics can be used to gain information about a population by examining a sample of the population; \ngeneralizations about a population from a sample are valid only if the sample is representative of that population.  \nUnderstand that random sampling tends to produce representative samples and support valid inferences.\n2.  Use data from a random sample to draw inferences about a population with an unknown characteristic of interest. Generate \nmultiple samples (or simulated samples) of the same size to gauge the variation in estimates or predictions. For example, \nestimate the mean word length in a book by randomly sampling words from the book; predict the winner of a school election \nbased on randomly sampled survey data. Gauge how far off the estimate or prediction might be.\nDraw informal comparative inferences about two populations.\n3.  Informally assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical data distributions with similar variabilities, measuring the \ndifference between the centers by expressing it as a multiple of a measure of variability. For example, the mean height of \nplayers on the basketball team is 10 cm greater than the mean height of players on the soccer team, about twice the  \nvariability (mean absolute deviation) on either team; on a dot plot, the separation between the two distributions of  \nheights is noticeable.\n4.  Use measures of center and measures of variability for numerical data from random samples to draw informal comparative \ninferences about two populations. For example, decide whether the words in a chapter of a seventh-grade science book are \ngenerally longer than the words in a chapter of a fourth-grade science book.\nInvestigate chance processes and develop, use, and evaluate probability models.\n5.  Understand that the probability of a chance event is a number between 0 and 1 that expresses the likelihood of the event \noccurring. Larger numbers indicate greater likelihood. A probability near 0 indicates an unlikely event, a probability around \n1/2 indicates an event that is neither unlikely nor likely, and a probability near 1 indicates a likely event.\n6.  Approximate the probability of a chance event by collecting data on the chance process that produces it and observing its \nlong-run relative frequency, and predict the approximate relative frequency given the probability. For example, when rolling  \na number cube 600 times, predict that a 3 or 6 would be rolled roughly 200 times, but probably not exactly 200 times.\nGrade 7\n\nGrade 7 7\n7.  Develop a probability model and use it to \ufb01nd probabilities of events. Compare probabilities from a model to observed \nfrequencies; if the agreement is not good, explain possible sources of the discrepancy.\na.  Develop a uniform probability model by assigning equal probability to all outcomes, and use the model to determine \nprobabilities of events. For example, if a student is selected at random from a class, \ufb01nd the probability that Jane will \nbe selected and the probability that a girl will be selected.\nb.  Develop a probability model (which may not be uniform) by observing frequencies in data generated from a chance  \nprocess. For example, \ufb01nd the approximate probability that a spinning penny will land heads up or that a tossed paper \ncup will land open-end down. Do the outcomes for the spinning penny appear to be equally likely based on the  \nobserved frequencies?\n8.  Find probabilities of compound events using organized lists, tables, tree diagrams, and simulation.\na.  Understand that, just as with simple events, the probability of a compound event is the fraction of outcomes in the \nsample space for which the compound event occurs.\nb.  Represent sample spaces for compound events using methods such as organized lists, tables and tree diagrams.  \nFor an event described in everyday language (e.g., \u201crolling double sixes\u201d), identify the outcomes in the sample space \nwhich compose the event.\nc.  Design and use a simulation to generate frequencies for compound events. For example, use random digits as a  \nsimulation tool to approximate the answer to the question: If 40% of donors have type A blood, what is the probability \nthat it will take at least 4 donors to \ufb01nd one with type A blood?\nGrade 7\nK\u20138 Standards  | 51",
