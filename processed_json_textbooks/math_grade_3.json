  "content": "Grade 3\nIn grade 3, instructional time should focus on four critical areas: (1) developing understanding of multiplication and division  \nand strategies for multiplication and division within 100; (2) developing understanding of fractions, especially unit fractions \n(fractions with numerator 1); (3) developing understanding of the structure of rectangular arrays and of area; and (4) describing \nand analyzing two-dimensional shapes. \n(1) Students develop an understanding of the meanings of multiplication and division of whole numbers through activities and \nproblems involving equal-sized groups, arrays, and area models; multiplication is \ufb01nding an unknown product, and division \nis \ufb01nding an unknown factor in these situations. For equal-sized group situations, division can require \ufb01nding the unknown \nnumber of groups or the unknown group size. Students use properties of operations to calculate products of whole numbers,  \nusing increasingly sophisticated strategies based on these properties to solve multiplication and division problems involving \nsingle-digit factors. By comparing a variety of solution strategies, students learn the relationship between multiplication and \ndivision. \n(2) Students develop an understanding of fractions, beginning with unit fractions. Students view fractions in general as being \nbuilt out of unit fractions, and they use fractions along with visual fraction models to represent parts of a whole. Students \nunderstand that the size of a fractional part is relative to the size of the whole. For example, 1/2 of the paint in a small \nbucket could be less paint than 1/3 of the paint in a larger bucket, but 1/3 of a ribbon is longer than 1/5 of the same  \nribbon because when the ribbon is divided into 3 equal parts, the parts are longer than when the ribbon is divided into  \n5 equal parts. Students are able to use fractions to represent numbers equal to, less than, and greater than one. They  \nsolve problems that involve comparing fractions by using visual fraction models and strategies based on noticing equal \nnumerators or denominators. \n(3) Students recognize area as an attribute of two-dimensional regions. They measure the area of a shape by \ufb01nding the total \nnumber of same-size units of area required to cover the shape without gaps or overlaps, a square with sides of unit length \nbeing the standard unit for measuring area. Students understand that rectangular arrays can be decomposed into identical  \nrows or into identical columns. By decomposing rectangles into rectangular arrays of squares, students connect area to \nmultiplication, and justify using multiplication to determine the area of a rectangle. \n(4) Students describe, analyze, and compare properties of two-dimensional shapes. They compare and classify shapes by their \nsides and angles, and connect these with de\ufb01nitions of shapes. Students also relate their fraction work to geometry by \nexpressing the area of part of a shape as a unit fraction of the whole.\nGrade 3\nK\u20138 Standards | 23\n\nGrade 3 Overview\nOperations and Algebraic Thinking\n\ue001 \nRepresent and solve problems involving multiplication and  \ndivision.\n\ue001\nUnderstand properties of multiplication and the relationship\nbetween multiplication and division.\n\ue001 \nMultiply and divide within 100.\n\ue001\nSolve problems involving the four operations, and identify\nand explain patterns in arithmetic.\nNumber and Operations in Base Ten\n\ue001 \nUse place value understanding and properties of operations  \nto perform multi-digit arithmetic.\nNumber and Operations\u2014Fractions\n\ue001\nDevelop understanding of fractions as numbers.\nMeasurement and Data\n\ue001 \nSolve problems involving measurement and estimation of  \nintervals of time, liquid volumes, and masses of objects.\n\ue001 \nRepresent and interpret data.\n\ue001 \nGeometric measurement: understand concepts of area and relate area to multiplication and to addition.\n\ue001 \nGeometric measurement: recognize perimeter as an attribute of plane \ufb01gures and distinguish between linear and area  \nmeasures.\nGeometry\n\ue001 \nReason with shapes and their attributes.\nMathematical Practices\n1.

Interpret products of whole numbers, e.g., interpret 5 \u00d7 7 as the total number of objects in 5 groups of 7 objects each.  \nFor example, describe a context in which a total number of objects can be expressed as 5 \u00d7 7. \n2.  Interpret whole-number quotients of whole numbers, e.g., interpret 56 \u00f7 8 as the number of objects in each share when 56 \nobjects are partitioned equally into 8 shares, or as a number of shares when 56 objects are partitioned into equal shares of 8 \nobjects each. For example, describe a context in which a number of shares or a number of groups can be expressed as 56\u00f78.\n3.  Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measure-\nment quantities, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.1\n4.  Determine the unknown whole number in a multiplication or division equation relating three whole numbers. For example, \ndetermine the unknown number that makes the equation true in each of the equations 8 \u00d7 ? = 48, 5 = \ue002 \u00f7 3, 6 \u00d7 6 = ?.\nUnderstand properties of multiplication and the relationship between multiplication and division.\n5. Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide.2 Examples: If 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 is known, then 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 is \nalso known. (Commutative property of multiplication.) 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 2 can be found by 3 \u00d7 5 = 15, then 15 \u00d7 2 = 30, or \nby 5 \u00d7 2 = 10, then 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. (Associative property of multiplication.) Knowing that 8 \u00d7 5 = 40 and 8 \u00d7 2 = 16,  \none can \ufb01nd 8 \u00d7 7 as 8 \u00d7 (5 + 2) = (8 \u00d7 5) + (8 \u00d7 2) = 40 + 16 = 56. (Distributive property.)\n6. Understand division as an unknown-factor problem. For example, \ufb01nd 32 \u00f7 8 by \ufb01nding the number that makes 32 when \nmultiplied by 8.\nMultiply and divide within 100.\n7. Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship between multiplication and division  \n(e.g., knowing that 8 \u00d7 5 = 40, one knows 40 \u00f7 5 = 8) or properties of operations. By the end of Grade 3, know from \nmemory all products of two one-digit numbers.\nSolve problems involving the four operations, and identify and explain patterns in arithmetic.\n8.  Solve two-step word problems using the four operations. Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing  \nfor the unknown quantity. Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies \nincluding rounding.32\n9.  Identify arithmetic patterns (including patterns in the addition table or multiplication table), and explain them using  \nproperties of operations. For example, observe that 4 times a number is always even, and explain why 4 times a number \ncan be decomposed into two equal addends.\nNumber and Operations in Base Ten \n3.NBT\nUse place value understanding and properties of operations to perform multi-digit arithmetic.4\n1. Use place value understanding to round whole numbers to the nearest 10 or 100.\n1. See Glossary, Table 2.\n2. Students need not use formal terms for these properties.\n3. This standard is limited to problems posed with whole numbers and having whole-number answers; students should know how to perform operations in \nthe conventional order when there are no parentheses to specify a particular order (Order of Operations).\n4. A range of algorithms may be used.\n\n3\nGrade 3\n2.  Fluently add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms based on place value, properties of operations,  \nand/or the relationship between addition and subtraction.\n3.  Multiply one-digit whole numbers by multiples of 10 in the range 10\u201390 (e.g., 9 \u00d7 80, 5 \u00d7 60) using strategies based on \nplace value and properties of operations.\nNumber and Operations\u2014Fractions5 \n3.NF\nDevelop understanding of fractions as numbers.3\n1.  Understand a fraction 1/b as the quantity formed by 1 part when a whole is partitioned into b equal parts; understand a \nfraction a/b as the quantity formed by a parts of size 1/b.\n2.  Understand a fraction as a number on the number line; represent fractions on a number line diagram.\na. Represent a fraction 1/b on a number line diagram by de\ufb01ning the interval from 0 to 1 as the whole and partitioning \nit into b equal parts. Recognize that each part has size 1/b and that the endpoint of the part based at 0 locates the \nnumber 1/b on the number line.\nb. Represent a fraction a/b on a number line diagram by marking off a lengths 1/b from 0. Recognize that the resulting \ninterval has size a/b and that its endpoint locates the number a/b on the number line.\n3.  Explain equivalence of fractions in special cases, and compare fractions by reasoning about their size.\na. Understand two fractions as equivalent (equal) if they are the same size, or the same point on a number line. \nb. Recognize and generate simple equivalent fractions, e.g., 1/2 = 2/4, 4/6 = 2/3). Explain why the fractions are  \nequivalent, e.g., by using a visual fraction model.\nc. Express whole numbers as fractions, and recognize fractions that are equivalent to whole numbers. Examples:  \nExpress 3 in the form 3 = 3/1; recognize that 6/1 = 6; locate 4/4 and 1 at the same point of a number line diagram.\nd.  Compare two fractions with the same numerator or the same denominator by reasoning about their size. Recognize that \ncomparisons are valid only when the two fractions refer to the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with the \nsymbols >, =, or <, and justify the conclusions, e.g., by using a visual fraction model.\nMeasurement and Data \n3.MD\nSolve problems involving measurement and estimation of intervals of time, liquid volumes, and masses of objects.\n1. Tell and write time to the nearest minute and measure time intervals in minutes. Solve word problems involving addition and \nsubtraction of time intervals in minutes, e.g., by representing the problem on a number line diagram.\n2. Measure and estimate liquid volumes and masses of objects using standard units of grams (g), kilograms (kg), and liters \n(l).6 Add, subtract, multiply, or divide to solve one-step word problems involving masses or volumes that are given in the \nsame units, e.g., by using drawings (such as a beaker with a measurement scale) to represent the problem.74\n5. Grade 3 expectations in this domain are limited to fractions with denominators 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.\n6. Excludes compound units such as cm3 and \ufb01nding the geometric volume of a container.\n7. Excludes multiplicative comparison problems (problems involving notions of \u201ctimes as much\u201d; see Glossary, Table 2).\n26 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 3\n\nGrade 3 3\nRepresent and interpret data.\n3.  Draw a scaled picture graph and a scaled bar graph to represent a data set with several categories. Solve one- and two-\nstep \u201chow many more\u201d and \u201chow many less\u201d problems using information presented in scaled bar graphs. For example, draw \na bar graph in which each square in the bar graph might represent 5 pets.\n4.  Generate measurement data by measuring lengths using rulers marked with halves and fourths of an inch. Show the data by \nmaking a line plot, where the horizontal scale is marked off in appropriate units\u2014whole numbers, halves, or quarters.\nGeometric measurement: understand concepts of area and relate area to multiplication and to addition.\n5.  Recognize area as an attribute of plane \ufb01gures and understand concepts of area measurement.\na.  A square with side length 1 unit, called \u201ca unit square,\u201d is said to have \u201cone square unit\u201d of area, and can be used to \nmeasure area.\nb.  A plane \ufb01gure which can be covered without gaps or overlaps by n unit squares is said to have an area of n square \nunits.\n6.  Measure areas by counting unit squares (square cm, square m, square in, square ft, and improvised units).\n7.  Relate area to the operations of multiplication and addition.\na.  Find the area of a rectangle with whole-number side lengths by tiling it, and show that the area is the same as would be \nfound by multiplying the side lengths.\nb.  Multiply side lengths to \ufb01nd areas of rectangles with whole-number side lengths in the context of solving real-world and \nmathematical problems, and represent whole-number products as rectangular areas in mathematical reasoning.\nc.  Use tiling to show in a concrete case that the area of a rectangle with whole-number side lengths a and b + c is the \nsum of a \u00d7 b and a \u00d7 c. Use area models to represent the distributive property in mathematical reasoning.\nd.  Recognize area as additive. Find areas of rectilinear \ufb01gures by decomposing them into non-overlapping rectangles and \nadding the areas of the non-overlapping parts, applying this technique to solve real-world problems.\nGeometric measurement: recognize perimeter as an attribute of plane \ufb01gures and distinguish between linear \nand area measures.\n8.  Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving perimeters of polygons, including \ufb01nding the perimeter given the side \nlengths, \ufb01nding an unknown side length, and exhibiting rectangles with the same perimeter and different areas or with the \nsame area and different perimeters.\nGeometry \n3.G\nReason with shapes and their attributes.\n1.  Understand that shapes in different categories (e.g., rhombuses, rectangles, and others) may share attributes (e.g., having \nfour sides), and that the shared attributes can de\ufb01ne a larger category (e.g., quadrilaterals). Recognize rhombuses,  \nrectangles, and squares as examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of \nthese subcategories.\n2.  Partition shapes into parts with equal areas. Express the area of each part as a unit fraction of the whole. For example, \npartition a shape into 4 parts with equal area, and describe the area of each part as 1/4 of the area of the shape.\nGrade 3\nK\u20138 Standards  | 27",
