  "content": "Kindergarten\nIn kindergarten, instructional time should focus on two critical areas: (1) representing, relating, and operating on whole  \nnumbers, initially with sets of objects; and (2) describing shapes and space. More learning time in kindergarten should be  \ndevoted to number than to other topics. \n(1) Students use numbers, including written numerals, to represent quantities and to solve quantitative problems, such as \ncounting objects in a set; counting out a given number of objects; comparing sets or numerals; and modeling simple joining \nand separating situations with sets of objects, or eventually with equations such as 5 + 2 = 7 and 7 \u2013 2 = 5. (Kindergarten \nstudents should see addition and subtraction equations, and student writing of equations in kindergarten is encouraged, \nbut it is not required.) Students choose, combine, and apply effective strategies for answering quantitative questions, \nincluding quickly recognizing the cardinalities of small sets of objects, counting and producing sets of given sizes, counting \nthe number of objects in combined sets, or counting the number of objects that remain in a set after some are taken away. \n(2) Students describe their physical world using geometric ideas (e.g., shape, orientation, spatial relations) and vocabulary. \nThey identify, name, and describe basic two-dimensional shapes, such as squares, triangles, circles, rectangles, and  \nhexagons, presented in a variety of ways (e.g., with different sizes and orientations), as well as three-dimensional shapes \nsuch as cubes, cones, cylinders, and spheres. They use basic shapes and spatial reasoning to model objects in their  \nenvironment and to construct more complex shapes.\n10 | K\u20138 Standards\nKindergarten\n\n \nKindergarten Overview\nCounting and Cardinality\n\ue001 \nKnow number names and the count sequence.\n\ue001 \nCount to tell the number of objects.\n\ue001 \nCompare numbers.\nOperations and Algebraic Thinking\n\ue001 \nUnderstand addition as putting together and adding to, and \nunderstand subtraction as taking apart and taking from.\nNumber and Operations in Base Ten\n\ue001 \nWork with numbers 11\u201319 to gain foundations for place value.\nMeasurement and Data\n\ue001 \nDescribe and compare measurable attributes.\n\ue001 \nClassify objects and count the number of objects in categories.\nGeometry\n\ue001 \nIdentify and describe shapes.\n\ue001 \nAnalyze, compare, create, and compose shapes.\nMathematical Practices\n1.

Model with mathematics.\n5. Use appropriate tools strategically.\n6.  Attend to precision.\n7.  Look for and make use of structure.\n8.  Look for and express regularity in repeated \nreasoning.\nKindergarten\nK\u20138 Standards | 11\n\nK\nKindergarten\nCounting and Cardinality \nK.CC\nKnow number names and the count sequence.\n1. Count to 100 by ones and by tens.\n2. Count forward beginning from a given number within the known sequence (instead of having to begin at 1).\n3. Write numbers from 0 to 20. Represent a number of objects with a written numeral 0\u201320 (with 0 representing a count of no \nobjects).\nCount to tell the number of objects.\n4. Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities; connect counting to cardinality.\na. When counting objects, say the number names in the standard order, pairing each object with one and only one number \nname and each number name with one and only one object.\nb. Understand that the last number name said tells the number of objects counted. The number of objects is the same \nregardless of their arrangement or the order in which they were counted.\nc. Understand that each successive number name refers to a quantity that is one larger.\n5. Count to answer \u201chow many?\u201d questions about as many as 20 things arranged in a line, a rectangular array, or a circle, or \nas many as 10 things in a scattered con\ufb01guration; given a number from 1\u201320, count out that many objects.\nCompare numbers.\n6. Identify whether the number of objects in one group is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of objects in another \ngroup, e.g., by using matching and counting strategies.1\n7. Compare two numbers between 1 and 10 presented as written numerals.\nOperations and Algebraic Thinking \nK.OA\nUnderstand addition as putting together and adding to, and understand subtraction as taking apart and taking \nfrom.\n1. Represent addition and subtraction with objects, \ufb01ngers, mental images, drawings,2 sounds (e.g., claps), acting out  \nsituations, verbal explanations, expressions, or equations.\n2. Solve addition and subtraction word problems, and add and subtract within 10, e.g., by using objects or drawings to  \nrepresent the problem.\n3. Decompose numbers less than or equal to 10 into pairs in more than one way, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and \nrecord each decomposition by a drawing or equation (e.g., 5 = 2 + 3 and 5 = 4 + 1).\n4. For any number from 1 to 9, \ufb01nd the number that makes 10 when added to the given number, e.g., by using objects or \ndrawings, and record the answer with a drawing or equation.\n5. Fluently add and subtract within 5.\n1. Includes groups with up to ten objects.\n2. Drawings need not show details, but should show the mathematics in the problem. (This applies wherever drawings are mentioned in the Standards.)\n12 2 | K\n| K\u20138 S\n8 Standards\nKindergarten\n\nKindergarten K\nNumber and Operations in Base Ten \nK.NBT\nWork with numbers 11\u201319 to gain foundations for place value.\n1. Compose and decompose numbers from 11 to 19 into ten ones and some further ones, e.g., by using objects or drawings, \nand record each composition or decomposition by a drawing or equation (e.g., 18 = 10 + 8); understand that these  \nnumbers are composed of ten ones and one, two, three, four, \ufb01ve, six, seven, eight, or nine ones.\nMeasurement and Data \nK.MD\nDescribe and compare measurable attributes.\n1.  Describe measurable attributes of objects, such as length or weight. Describe several measurable attributes of a single \nobject.\n2.  Directly compare two objects with a measurable attribute in common, to see which object has \u201cmore of\u201d/\u201cless of\u201d the  \nattribute, and describe the difference. For example, directly compare the heights of two children and describe one child as \ntaller/shorter.\nClassify objects and count the number of objects in each category.\n3.  Classify objects into given categories; count the numbers of objects in each category and sort the categories by count.3\nGeometry \nK.G\nIdentify and describe shapes (squares, circles, triangles, rectangles, hexagons, cubes, cones, cylinders, and \nspheres).\n1.  Describe objects in the environment using names of shapes, and describe the relative positions of these objects using \nterms such as above, below, beside, in front of, behind, and next to.\n2.  Correctly name shapes regardless of their orientations or overall size.\n3.  Identify shapes as two-dimensional (lying in a plane, \u201c\ufb02at\u201d) or three-dimensional (\u201csolid\u201d).\nAnalyze, compare, create, and compose shapes.\n4.  Analyze and compare two- and three-dimensional shapes, in different sizes and orientations, using informal language  \nto describe their similarities, differences, parts (e.g., number of sides and vertices/\u201ccorners\u201d) and other attributes  \n(e.g., having sides of equal length).\n5.  Model shapes in the world by building shapes from components (e.g., sticks and clay balls) and drawing shapes.\n6.  Compose simple shapes to form larger shapes. For example, \u201cCan you join these two triangles with full sides touching to \nmake a rectangle?\u201d\n3. Limit category counts to be less than or equal to 10.\nKindergarten\nK\u20138 Standards  | 13",
