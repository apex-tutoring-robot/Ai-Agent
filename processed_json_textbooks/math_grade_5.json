  "content": "Grade 5\nIn grade 5, instructional time should focus on three critical areas: (1) developing \ufb02uency with addition and subtraction of  \nfractions, and developing understanding of the multiplication of fractions and of division of fractions in limited cases (unit  \nfractions divided by whole numbers and whole numbers divided by unit fractions); (2) extending division to two-digit divisors, \nintegrating decimal fractions into the place value system and developing understanding of operations with decimals to  \nhundredths, and developing \ufb02uency with whole number and decimal operations; and (3) developing understanding of volume.\n(1) Students apply their understanding of fractions and fraction models to represent the addition and subtraction of fractions \nwith unlike denominators as equivalent calculations with like denominators. They develop \ufb02uency in calculating sums and \ndifferences of fractions, and make reasonable estimates of them. Students also use the meaning of fractions, of multiplica-\ntion and division, and the relationship between multiplication and division to understand and explain why the procedures for \nmultiplying and dividing fractions make sense. (Note: this is limited to the case of dividing unit fractions by whole numbers \nand whole numbers by unit fractions.) \n(2) Students develop understanding of why division procedures work based on the meaning of base-ten numerals and  \nproperties of operations. They \ufb01nalize \ufb02uency with multi-digit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They apply \ntheir understandings of models for decimals, decimal notation, and properties of operations to add and subtract decimals \nto hundredths. They develop \ufb02uency in these computations, and make reasonable estimates of their results. Students use  \nthe relationship between decimals and fractions, as well as the relationship between \ufb01nite decimals and whole numbers  \n(i.e., a \ufb01nite decimal multiplied by an appropriate power of 10 is a whole number), to understand and explain why the \nprocedures for multiplying and dividing \ufb01nite decimals make sense. They compute products and quotients of decimals to \nhundredths ef\ufb01ciently and accurately. \n(3) Students recognize volume as an attribute of three-dimensional space. They understand that volume can be measured by \n\ufb01nding the total number of same-size units of volume required to \ufb01ll the space without gaps or overlaps. They understand \nthat a 1-unit by 1-unit by 1-unit cube is the standard unit for measuring volume. They select appropriate units, strategies, \nand tools for solving problems that involve estimating and measuring volume. They decompose three-dimensional shapes \nand \ufb01nd volumes of right rectangular prisms by viewing them as decomposed into layers of arrays of cubes. They measure \nnecessary attributes of shapes in order to determine volumes to solve real-world and mathematical problems.\n34 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 5\n\n \nGrade 5 Overview\nOperations and Algebraic Thinking\n\ue001 \nWrite and interpret numerical expressions.\n\ue001 \nAnalyze patterns and relationships.\nNumber and Operations in Base Ten\n\ue001 \nUnderstand the place value system.\n\ue001 \nPerform operations with multi-digit whole numbers and with \ndecimals to hundredths.\nNumber and Operations\u2014Fractions\n\ue001 \nUse equivalent fractions as a strategy to add and subtract  \nfractions.\n\ue001 \nApply and extend previous understandings of multiplication  \nand division to multiply and divide fractions.\nMeasurement and Data\n\ue001 \nConvert like measurement units within a given measurement \nsystem.\n\ue001 \nRepresent and interpret data.\n\ue001 \nGeometric measurement: understand concepts of volume and relate volume to multiplication and to addition.\nGeometry\n\ue001 \nGraph points on the coordinate plane to solve real-world and mathematical problems.\n\ue001 \nClassify two-dimensional \ufb01gures into categories based on their properties.\nMathematical Practices\n1.  Make sense of problems and persevere in  \nsolving them.\n2.  Reason abstractly and quantitatively.\n3.  Construct viable arguments and critique the \n \nreasoning of others.\n4.  Model with mathematics.\n5.  Use appropriate tools strategically.\n6.  Attend to precision.\n7.  Look for and make use of structure.\n8.  Look for and express regularity in repeated \nreasoning.\n \nGrade 5\nK\u20138 Standards | 35\n\n5\nGrade 5\nOperations and Algebraic Thinking \n5.OA\nWrite and interpret numerical expressions.\n1.  Use parentheses, brackets, or braces in numerical expressions, and evaluate expressions with these symbols.\n2.  Write simple expressions that record calculations with numbers, and interpret numerical expressions without evaluating \nthem. For example, express the calculation \u201cadd 8 and 7, then multiply by 2\u201d as 2 \u00d7 (8 + 7). Recognize that  \n3 \u00d7 (18932 + 921) is three times as large as 18932 + 921, without having to calculate the indicated sum or product.\n2.1 Express a whole number in the range 2\u201350 as a product of its prime factors. For example, \ufb01nd the prime factors of 24 and \nexpress 24 as 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3. CA\nAnalyze patterns and relationships.\n3.  Generate two numerical patterns using two given rules. Identify apparent relationships between corresponding terms. Form \nordered pairs consisting of corresponding terms from the two patterns, and graph the ordered pairs on a coordinate plane. \nFor example, given the rule \u201cAdd 3\u201d and the starting number 0, and given the rule \u201cAdd 6\u201d and the starting number 0,  \ngenerate terms in the resulting sequences, and observe that the terms in one sequence are twice the corresponding terms \nin the other sequence. Explain informally why this is so.\nNumber and Operations in Base Ten \n5.NBT\nUnderstand the place value system.\n1.  Recognize that in a multi-digit number, a digit in one place represents 10 times as much as it represents in the place to its \nright and 1/10 of what it represents in the place to its left.\n2.  Explain patterns in the number of zeros of the product when multiplying a number by powers of 10, and explain patterns in \nthe placement of the decimal point when a decimal is multiplied or divided by a power of 10. Use whole-number exponents \nto denote powers of 10.\n3.  Read, write, and compare decimals to thousandths.\na.  Read and write decimals to thousandths using base-ten numerals, number names, and expanded form, e.g.,  \n347.392 = 3 \u00d7 100 + 4 \u00d7 10 + 7 \u00d7 1 + 3 \u00d7 (1/10) + 9 \u00d7 (1/100) + 2 \u00d7 (1/1000).\nb.  Compare two decimals to thousandths based on meanings of the digits in each place, using >, =, and < symbols to \nrecord the results of comparisons.\n4.  Use place value understanding to round decimals to any place.\nPerform operations with multi-digit whole numbers and with decimals to hundredths.\n5.  Fluently multiply multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.\n6.  Find whole-number quotients of whole numbers with up to four-digit dividends and two-digit divisors, using strategies based \non place value, the properties of operations, and/or the relationship between multiplication and division. Illustrate and \nexplain the calculation by using equations, rectangular arrays, and/or area models.\n7.  Add, subtract, multiply, and divide decimals to hundredths, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on \nplace value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction; relate the strategy to a \nwritten method and explain the reasoning used.\n36 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 5\n\nGrade 5 5\nNumber and Operations\u2014Fractions \n5.NF\nUse equivalent fractions as a strategy to add and subtract fractions.\n1.  Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators (including mixed numbers) by replacing given fractions with equivalent \nfractions in such a way as to produce an equivalent sum or difference of fractions with like denominators. For example, \n2/3 + 5/4 = 8/12 + 15/12 = 23/12. (In general, a/b + c/d = (ad + bc)/bd.)\n2.  Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions referring to the same whole, including cases of unlike \ndenominators, e.g., by using visual fraction models or equations to represent the problem. Use benchmark fractions and \nnumber sense of fractions to estimate mentally and assess the reasonableness of answers. For example, recognize an \nincorrect result 2/5 + 1/2 = 3/7, by observing that 3/7 < 1/2.\nApply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division to multiply and divide fractions.\n3.  Interpret a fraction as division of the numerator by the denominator (a/b = a \u00f7 b). Solve word problems involving division  \nof whole numbers leading to answers in the form of fractions or mixed numbers, e.g., by using visual fraction models or \nequations to represent the problem. For example, interpret 3/4 as the result of dividing 3 by 4, noting that 3/4 multiplied \nby 4 equals 3, and that when 3 wholes are shared equally among 4 people each person has a share of size 3/4. If 9 people \nwant to share a 50-pound sack of rice equally by weight, how many pounds of rice should each person get? Between what \ntwo whole numbers does your answer lie? \n4.  Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction or whole number by a fraction.\na. Interpret the product (a/b) \u00d7 q as a parts of a partition of q into b equal parts; equivalently, as the result of a sequence \nof operations a \u00d7 q \u00f7 b. For example, use a visual fraction model to show (2/3) \u00d7 4 = 8/3, and create a story context \nfor this equation. Do the same with (2/3) \u00d7 (4/5) = 8/15. (In general, (a/b) \u00d7 (c/d) = ac/bd.)\nb. Find the area of a rectangle with fractional side lengths by tiling it with unit squares of the appropriate unit fraction side \nlengths, and show that the area is the same as would be found by multiplying the side lengths. Multiply fractional side \nlengths to \ufb01nd areas of rectangles, and represent fraction products as rectangular areas.\n5.  Interpret multiplication as scaling (resizing), by:\na.  Comparing the size of a product to the size of one factor on the basis of the size of the other factor, without performing \nthe indicated multiplication.\nb.  Explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction greater than 1 results in a product greater than the given \nnumber (recognizing multiplication by whole numbers greater than 1 as a familiar case); explaining why multiplying a \ngiven number by a fraction less than 1 results in a product smaller than the given number; and relating the principle of \nfraction equivalence a/b = (n \u00d7 a)/(n \u00d7 b) to the effect of multiplying a/b by 1.\n6.  Solve real-world problems involving multiplication of fractions and mixed numbers, e.g., by using visual fraction models or \nequations to represent the problem.\n7.  Apply and extend previous understandings of division to divide unit fractions by whole numbers and whole numbers by unit \nfractions.1\na.  Interpret division of a unit fraction by a non-zero whole number, and compute such quotients. For example, create  \na story context for (1/3) \u00f7 4, and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between  \nmultiplication and division to explain that (1/3) \u00f7 4 = 1/12 because (1/12) \u00d7 4 = 1/3.\n1. Students able to multiply fractions in general can develop strategies to divide fractions in general, by reasoning about the relationship between  \nmultiplication and division. But division of a fraction by a fraction is not a requirement at this grade.\nGrade 5\nK\u20138 Standards  | 37\n\n5\nGrade 5\nb.  Interpret division of a whole number by a unit fraction, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context \nfor 4 \u00f7 (1/5), and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and \ndivision to explain that 4 \u00f7 (1/5) = 20 because 20 \u00d7 (1/5) = 4.\nc.  Solve real-world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers \nby unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. For example, how much \nchocolate will each person get if 3 people share 1/2 lb of chocolate equally? How many 1/3-cup servings are in 2 cups \nof raisins?\nMeasurement and Data \n5.MD\nConvert like measurement units within a given measurement system.\n1.  Convert among different-sized standard measurement units within a given measurement system (e.g., convert 5 cm to  \n0.05 m), and use these conversions in solving multi-step, real-world problems.\nRepresent and interpret data.\n2.  Make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Use operations on fractions \nfor this grade to solve problems involving information presented in line plots. For example, given different measurements of \nliquid in identical beakers, \ufb01nd the amount of liquid each beaker would contain if the total amount in all the beakers were  \nredistributed equally.\nGeometric measurement: understand concepts of volume and relate volume to multiplication and to addition.\n3.  Recognize volume as an attribute of solid \ufb01gures and understand concepts of volume measurement.\na.  A cube with side length 1 unit, called a \u201cunit cube,\u201d is said to have \u201cone cubic unit\u201d of volume, and can be used to  \nmeasure volume.\nb.  A solid \ufb01gure which can be packed without gaps or overlaps using n unit cubes is said to have a volume of n cubic units.\n4.  Measure volumes by counting unit cubes, using cubic cm, cubic in, cubic ft, and improvised units.\n5.  Relate volume to the operations of multiplication and addition and solve real-world and mathematical problems involving \nvolume.\na.  Find the volume of a right rectangular prism with whole-number side lengths by packing it with unit cubes, and show \nthat the volume is the same as would be found by multiplying the edge lengths, equivalently by multiplying the height \nby the area of the base. Represent threefold whole-number products as volumes, e.g., to represent the associative \nproperty of multiplication.\nb.  Apply the formulas V = l \u00d7 w \u00d7 h and V = b \u00d7 h for rectangular prisms to \ufb01nd volumes of right rectangular prisms with \nwhole-number edge lengths in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.\nc.  Recognize volume as additive. Find volumes of solid \ufb01gures composed of two non-overlapping right rectangular prisms \nby adding the volumes of the non-overlapping parts, applying this technique to solve real-world problems.\n38 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 5\n\nGrade 5 5\nGeometry \n5.G\nGraph points on the coordinate plane to solve real-world and mathematical problems.\n1.  Use a pair of perpendicular number lines, called axes, to de\ufb01ne a coordinate system, with the intersection of the lines  \n(the origin) arranged to coincide with the 0 on each line and a given point in the plane located by using an ordered pair of \nnumbers, called its coordinates. Understand that the \ufb01rst number indicates how far to travel from the origin in the direction \nof one axis, and the second number indicates how far to travel in the direction of the second axis, with the convention that \nthe names of the two axes and the coordinates correspond (e.g., x-axis and x-coordinate, y-axis and y-coordinate).\n2.  Represent real-world and mathematical problems by graphing points in the \ufb01rst quadrant of the coordinate plane, and  \ninterpret coordinate values of points in the context of the situation.\nClassify two-dimensional \ufb01gures into categories based on their properties.\n3.  Understand that attributes belonging to a category of two-dimensional \ufb01gures also belong to all subcategories of that cat-\negory. For example, all rectangles have four right angles and squares are rectangles, so all squares have four right angles.\n4.  Classify two-dimensional \ufb01gures in a hierarchy based on properties.\nGrade 5\nK\u20138 Standards  | 39",
