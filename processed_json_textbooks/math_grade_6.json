  "content": "Grade 6\nIn grade 6, instructional time should focus on four critical areas: (1) connecting ratio and rate to whole number multiplication \nand division, and using concepts of ratio and rate to solve problems; (2) completing understanding of division of fractions and \nextending the notion of number to the system of rational numbers, which includes negative numbers; (3) writing, interpreting, \nand using expressions and equations; and (4) developing understanding of statistical thinking. \n(1) Students use reasoning about multiplication and division to solve ratio and rate problems about quantities. By viewing \nequivalent ratios and rates as deriving from, and extending, pairs of rows (or columns) in the multiplication table, and by \nanalyzing simple drawings that indicate the relative size of quantities, students connect their understanding of multiplication \nand division with ratios and rates. Thus students expand the scope of problems for which they can use multiplication and \ndivision to solve problems, and they connect ratios and fractions. Students solve a wide variety of problems involving  \nratios and rates.\n(2) Students use the meaning of fractions, the meanings of multiplication and division, and the relationship between multipli-\ncation and division to understand and explain why the procedures for dividing fractions make sense. Students use these \noperations to solve problems. Students extend their previous understandings of number and the ordering of numbers to  \nthe full system of rational numbers, which includes negative rational numbers, and in particular negative integers. They \nreason about the order and absolute value of rational numbers and about the location of points in all four quadrants of  \nthe coordinate plane.\n(3) Students understand the use of variables in mathematical expressions. They write expressions and equations that  \ncorrespond to given situations, evaluate expressions, and use expressions and formulas to solve problems. Students under-\nstand that expressions in different forms can be equivalent, and they use the properties of operations to rewrite expressions \nin equivalent forms. Students know that the solutions of an equation are the values of the variables that make the equation \ntrue. Students use properties of operations and the idea of maintaining the equality of both sides of an equation to solve \nsimple one-step equations. Students construct and analyze tables, such as tables of quantities that are in equivalent ratios, \nand they use equations (such as 3x = y) to describe relationships between quantities.\n(4) Building on and reinforcing their understanding of number, students begin to develop their ability to think statistically. \nStudents recognize that a data distribution may not have a de\ufb01nite center and that different ways to measure center yield \ndifferent values. The median measures center in the sense that it is roughly the middle value. The mean measures center \nin the sense that it is the value that each data point would take on if the total of the data values were redistributed equally, \nand also in the sense that it is a balance point. Students recognize that a measure of variability (interquartile range or mean \nabsolute deviation) can also be useful for summarizing data because two very different sets of data can have the same\nmean and median yet be distinguished by their variability. Students learn to describe and summarize numerical data sets, \nidentifying clusters, peaks, gaps, and symmetry, considering the context in which the data were collected.\nStudents in grade 6 also build on their work with area in elementary school by reasoning about relationships among shapes \nto determine area, surface area, and volume. They \ufb01nd areas of right triangles, other triangles, and special quadrilaterals by \ndecomposing these shapes, rearranging or removing pieces, and relating the shapes to rectangles. Using these methods, \nstudents discuss, develop, and justify formulas for areas of triangles and parallelograms. Students \ufb01nd areas of polygons \nand surface areas of prisms and pyramids by decomposing them into pieces whose area they can determine. They reason \nabout right rectangular prisms with fractional side lengths to extend formulas for the volume of a right rectangular prism to \nfractional side lengths. They prepare for work on scale drawings and constructions in grade 7 by drawing polygons in the \ncoordinate plane.\n40 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 6\n\n \nGrade 6 Overview\nRatios and Proportional Relationships\n\ue001\nUnderstand ratio concepts and use ratio reasoning to solve\nproblems.\nThe Number System\n\ue001 \nApply and extend previous understandings of multiplication  \nand division to divide fractions by fractions.\n\ue001 \nCompute \ufb02uently with multi-digit numbers and \ufb01nd common  \nfactors and multiples.\n\ue001 \nApply and extend previous understandings of numbers to  \nthe system of rational numbers.\nExpressions and Equations\n\ue001 \nApply and extend previous understandings of arithmetic  \nto algebraic expressions.\n\ue001 \nReason about and solve one-variable equations and  \ninequalities.\n\ue001 \nRepresent and analyze quantitative relationships between  \ndependent and independent variables.\nGeometry\n\ue001 \nSolve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume.\nStatistics and Probability\n\ue001 \nDevelop understanding of statistical variability.\n\ue001 \nSummarize and describe distributions.\nMathematical Practices\n1.

Model with mathematics.\n5.  Use appropriate tools strategically.\n6. Attend to precision.\n7.  Look for and make use of structure.\n8.  Look for and express regularity in repeated \nreasoning.\nGrade 6\nK\u20138 Standards | 41\n\n6\nGrade 6\nRatios and Proportional Relationships \n6.RP\nUnderstand ratio concepts and use ratio reasoning to solve problems.\n1.  Understand the concept of a ratio and use ratio language to describe a ratio relationship between two quantities. For  \nexample, \u201cThe ratio of wings to beaks in the bird house at the zoo was 2:1, because for every 2 wings there was 1 beak.\u201d \n\u201cFor every vote candidate A received, candidate C received nearly three votes.\u201d\n2.  Understand the concept of a unit rate a/b associated with a ratio a:b with b \u2260 0, and use rate language in the context of a \nratio relationship. For example, \u201cThis recipe has a ratio of 3 cups of \ufb02our to 4 cups of sugar, so there is 3/4 cup of \ufb02our for \neach cup of sugar.\u201d \u201cWe paid $75 for 15 hamburgers, which is a rate of $5 per hamburger.\u201d1\n3.  Use ratio and rate reasoning to solve real-world and mathematical problems, e.g., by reasoning about tables of equivalent \nratios, tape diagrams, double number line diagrams, or equations.\na.  Make tables of equivalent ratios relating quantities with whole number measurements, \ufb01nd missing values in the tables, \nand plot the pairs of values on the coordinate plane. Use tables to compare ratios.\nb.  Solve unit rate problems including those involving unit pricing and constant speed. For example, if it took 7 hours to \nmow 4 lawns, then at that rate, how many lawns could be mowed in 35 hours? At what rate were lawns being mowed?\nc.  Find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100 (e.g., 30% of a quantity means 30/100 times the quantity); solve  \nproblems involving \ufb01nding the whole, given a part and the percent.\nd.  Use ratio reasoning to convert measurement units; manipulate and transform units appropriately when multiplying or \ndividing quantities.\nThe Number System \n6.NS\nApply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division to divide fractions by fractions.\n1. Interpret and compute quotients of fractions, and solve word problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by \nusing visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. For example, create a story context for (2/3) \u00f7 (3/4) \nand use a visual fraction model to show the quotient; use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain \nthat (2/3) \u00f7 (3/4) = 8/9 because 3/4 of 8/9 is 2/3. (In general, (a/b) \u00f7 (c/d) = ad/bc.) How much chocolate will each \nperson get if 3 people share 1/2 lb of chocolate equally? How many 3/4-cup servings are in 2/3 of a cup of yogurt? How \nwide is a rectangular strip of land with length 3/4 mi and area 1/2 square mi?\nCompute \ufb02uently with multi-digit numbers and \ufb01nd common factors and multiples.\n2.  Fluently divide multi-digit numbers using the standard algorithm.\n3.  Fluently add, subtract, multiply, and divide multi-digit decimals using the standard algorithm for each operation.\n4.  Find the greatest common factor of two whole numbers less than or equal to 100 and the least common multiple of two whole  \nnumbers less than or equal to 12. Use the distributive property to express a sum of two whole numbers 1\u2013100 with a com-\nmon factor as a multiple of a sum of two whole numbers with no common factor. For example, express 36 + 8 as 4 (9 + 2).\n1. Expectations for unit rates in this grade are limited to non-complex fractions.\n42 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 6\n\nGrade 6 6\nApply and extend previous understandings of numbers to the system of rational numbers.\n5.  Understand that positive and negative numbers are used together to describe quantities having opposite directions or \nvalues (e.g., temperature above/below zero, elevation above/below sea level, credits/debits, positive/negative electric \ncharge); use positive and negative numbers to represent quantities in real-world contexts, explaining the meaning of 0 in \neach situation.\n6.  Understand a rational number as a point on the number line. Extend number line diagrams and coordinate axes familiar \nfrom previous grades to represent points on the line and in the plane with negative number coordinates.\na.  Recognize opposite signs of numbers as indicating locations on opposite sides of 0 on the number line; recognize that \nthe opposite of the opposite of a number is the number itself, e.g., \u2013(\u20133) = 3, and that 0 is its own opposite.\nb.  Understand signs of numbers in ordered pairs as indicating locations in quadrants of the coordinate plane; recognize \nthat when two ordered pairs differ only by signs, the locations of the points are related by re\ufb02ections across one or \nboth axes.\nc.  Find and position integers and other rational numbers on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram; \ufb01nd and position \npairs of integers and other rational numbers on a coordinate plane.\n7.  Understand ordering and absolute value of rational numbers.\na.  Interpret statements of inequality as statements about the relative position of two numbers on a number line diagram. For \nexample, interpret \u20133 > \u20137 as a statement that \u20133 is located to the right of \u20137 on a number line oriented from left to right.\nb.  Write, interpret, and explain statements of order for rational numbers in real-world contexts. For example, write  \n\u20133\u00b0C > \u20137\u00b0C to express the fact that \u20133\u00b0C is warmer than \u20137\u00b0C.\nc.  Understand the absolute value of a rational number as its distance from 0 on the number line; interpret absolute value \nas magnitude for a positive or negative quantity in a real-world situation. For example, for an account balance of  \n\u201330 dollars, write |\u201330| = 30 to describe the size of the debt in dollars.\nd.  Distinguish comparisons of absolute value from statements about order. For example, recognize that an account balance \nless than \u201330 dollars represents a debt greater than 30 dollars.\n8.  Solve real-world and mathematical problems by graphing points in all four quadrants of the coordinate plane. Include use \nof coordinates and absolute value to \ufb01nd distances between points with the same \ufb01rst coordinate or the same second \ncoordinate.\nExpressions and Equations \n6.EE\nApply and extend previous understandings of arithmetic to algebraic expressions.\n1.  Write and evaluate numerical expressions involving whole-number exponents.\n2.  Write, read, and evaluate expressions in which letters stand for numbers.\na.  Write expressions that record operations with numbers and with letters standing for numbers. For example, express  \nthe calculation \u201cSubtract y from 5\u201d as 5 \u2013 y.\nb.  Identify parts of an expression using mathematical terms (sum, term, product, factor, quotient, coef\ufb01cient); view one \nor more parts of an expression as a single entity. For example, describe the expression 2 (8 + 7) as a product of two \nfactors; view (8 + 7) as both a single entity and a sum of two terms.\nGrade 6\nK\u20138 Standards  | 43\n\n6\nGrade 6\nc.  Evaluate expressions at speci\ufb01c values of their variables. Include expressions that arise from formulas used in real-\nworld problems. Perform arithmetic operations, including those involving whole-number exponents, in the conventional \norder when there are no parentheses to specify a particular order (Order of Operations). For example, use the formulas \nV = s3 and A = 6 s2 to \ufb01nd the volume and surface area of a cube with sides of length s = 1/2.\n3.  Apply the properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions. For example, apply the distributive property to  \nthe expression 3 (2 + x) to produce the equivalent expression 6 + 3x; apply the distributive property to the expression  \n24x + 18y to produce the equivalent expression 6 (4x + 3y); apply properties of operations to y + y + y to produce the \nequivalent expression 3y.\n4.  Identify when two expressions are equivalent (i.e., when the two expressions name the same number regardless of which \nvalue is substituted into them). For example, the expressions y + y + y and 3y are equivalent because they name the same\nnumber regardless of which number y stands for.\nReason about and solve one-variable equations and inequalities.\n5.  Understand solving an equation or inequality as a process of answering a question: which values from a speci\ufb01ed set, if \nany, make the equation or inequality true? Use substitution to determine whether a given number in a speci\ufb01ed set makes \nan equation or inequality true.\n6.  Use variables to represent numbers and write expressions when solving a real-world or mathematical problem; understand \nthat a variable can represent an unknown number, or, depending on the purpose at hand, any number in a speci\ufb01ed set.\n7.  Solve real-world and mathematical problems by writing and solving equations of the form x + p = q and px = q for cases in \nwhich p, q and x are all nonnegative rational numbers.\n8.  Write an inequality of the form x > c or x < c to represent a constraint or condition in a real-world or mathematical problem. \nRecognize that inequalities of the form x > c or x < c have in\ufb01nitely many solutions; represent solutions of such inequalities \non number line diagrams.\nRepresent and analyze quantitative relationships between dependent and independent variables.\n9.  Use variables to represent two quantities in a real-world problem that change in relationship to one another; write an  \nequation to express one quantity, thought of as the dependent variable, in terms of the other quantity, thought of as the \nindependent variable. Analyze the relationship between the dependent and independent variables using graphs and tables, \nand relate these to the equation. For example, in a problem involving motion at constant speed, list and graph ordered  \npairs of distances and times, and write the equation d = 65t to represent the relationship between distance and time.\nGeometry \n6.G\nSolve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume.\n1.  Find the area of right triangles, other triangles, special quadrilaterals, and polygons by composing into rectangles or  \ndecomposing into triangles and other shapes; apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical \nproblems.\n2.  Find the volume of a right rectangular prism with fractional edge lengths by packing it with unit cubes of the appropriate \nunit fraction edge lengths, and show that the volume is the same as would be found by multiplying the edge lengths of the \nprism. Apply the formulas V = l w h and V = b h to \ufb01nd volumes of right rectangular prisms with fractional edge lengths in \nthe context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.\n44 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 6\n\nGrade 6 6\n3.  Draw polygons in the coordinate plane given coordinates for the vertices; use coordinates to \ufb01nd the length of a side joining \npoints with the same \ufb01rst coordinate or the same second coordinate. Apply these techniques in the context of solving  \nreal-world and mathematical problems.\n4.  Represent three-dimensional \ufb01gures using nets made up of rectangles and triangles, and use the nets to \ufb01nd the surface \narea of these \ufb01gures. Apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.\nStatistics and Probability \n6.SP\nDevelop understanding of statistical variability.\n1.  Recognize a statistical question as one that anticipates variability in the data related to the question and accounts for it in \nthe answers. For example, \u201cHow old am I?\u201d is not a statistical question, but \u201cHow old are the students in my school?\u201d is a \nstatistical question because one anticipates variability in students\u2019 ages.\n2.  Understand that a set of data collected to answer a statistical question has a distribution which can be described by its \ncenter, spread, and overall shape.\n3.  Recognize that a measure of center for a numerical data set summarizes all of its values with a single number, while a  \nmeasure of variation describes how its values vary with a single number.\nSummarize and describe distributions.\n4.  Display numerical data in plots on a number line, including dot plots, histograms, and box plots.\n5.  Summarize numerical data sets in relation to their context, such as by:\na.  Reporting the number of observations.\nb.  Describing the nature of the attribute under investigation, including how it was measured and its units of measurement.\nc.  Giving quantitative measures of center (median and/or mean) and variability (interquartile range and/or mean absolute \ndeviation), as well as describing any overall pattern and any striking deviations from the overall pattern with reference \nto the context in which the data were gathered.\nd.  Relating the choice of measures of center and variability to the shape of the data distribution and the context in which \nthe data were gathered.\nGrade 6\nK\u20138 Standards  | 45",
