  "content": "Grade 8\nIn grade 8, instructional time should focus on three critical areas: (1) formulating and reasoning about expressions and  \nequations, including modeling an association in bivariate data with a linear equation, and solving linear equations and systems \nof linear equations; (2) grasping the concept of a function and using functions to describe quantitative relationships; (3) analyz-\ning two- and three-dimensional space and \ufb01gures using distance, angle, similarity, and congruence, and understanding and \napplying the Pythagorean Theorem. \n(1) Students use linear equations and systems of linear equations to represent, analyze, and solve a variety of problems. \nStudents recognize equations for proportions (y/x = m or y = mx) as special linear equations (y = mx + b), understanding \nthat the constant of proportionality (m) is the slope, and the graphs are lines through the origin. They understand that the \nslope (m) of a line is a constant rate of change, so that if the input or x-coordinate changes by an amount A, the output or \ny-coordinate changes by the amount m . A. Students also use a linear equation to describe the association between two \nquantities in bivariate data (such as arm span versus height for students in a classroom). At this grade, \ufb01tting the model \nand assessing its \ufb01t to the data are done informally. Interpreting the model in the context of the data requires students \nto express a relationship between the two quantities in question and to interpret components of the relationship (such as \nslope and y-intercept) in terms of the situation.\nStudents strategically choose and ef\ufb01ciently implement procedures to solve linear equations in one variable, understanding  \nthat when they use the properties of equality and the concept of logical equivalence, they maintain the solutions of the \noriginal equation. Students solve systems of two linear equations in two variables and relate the systems to pairs of lines \nin the plane; these intersect, are parallel, or are the same line. Students use linear equations, systems of linear equations, \nlinear functions, and their understanding of slope of a line to analyze situations and solve problems.\n(2)  Students grasp the concept of a function as a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. They understand that \nfunctions describe situations where one quantity determines another. They can translate among representations and partial \nrepresentations of functions (noting that tabular and graphical representations may be partial representations), and they \ndescribe how aspects of the function are re\ufb02ected in the different representations.\n(3)  Students use ideas about distance and angles, how they behave under translations, rotations, re\ufb02ections, and dilations, \nand ideas about congruence and similarity to describe and analyze two-dimensional \ufb01gures and to solve problems. Students  \nshow that the sum of the angles in a triangle is the angle formed by a straight line, and that various con\ufb01gurations of lines \ngive rise to similar triangles because of the angles created when a transversal cuts parallel lines. Students understand the \nstatement of the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse, and can explain why the Pythagorean Theorem holds, for example, \nby decomposing a square in two different ways. They apply the Pythagorean Theorem to \ufb01nd distances between points on \nthe coordinate plane, to \ufb01nd lengths, and to analyze polygons. Students complete their work on volume by solving problems \ninvolving cones, cylinders, and spheres.\n52 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 8\n\n \nGrade 8 Overview\nThe Number System\n\ue001 \nKnow that there are numbers that are not rational, and  \napproximate them by rational numbers. \nExpressions and Equations\n\ue001 \nWork with radicals and integer exponents.\n\ue001 \nUnderstand the connection between proportional  \nrelationships, lines, and linear equations.\n\ue001 \nAnalyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous  \nlinear equations.\nFunctions\n\ue001 \nDe\ufb01ne, evaluate, and compare functions.\n\ue001 \nUse functions to model relationships between quantities.\nGeometry\n\ue001 \nUnderstand congruence and similarity using physical models,  \ntransparencies, or geometry software.\n\ue001 \nUnderstand and apply the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\ue001 \nSolve real-world and mathematical problems involving volume of cylinders, cones, and spheres.\nStatistics and Probability\n\ue001 \nInvestigate patterns of association in bivariate data.\nMathematical Practices\n1.  Make sense of problems and persevere in \nsolving them.\n2.  Reason abstractly and quantitatively.\n3.  Construct viable arguments and critique the \nreasoning of others.\n4.  Model with mathematics.\n5.  Use appropriate tools strategically.\n6.  Attend to precision.\n7.  Look for and make use of structure.\n8.  Look for and express regularity in repeated \nreasoning.\nGrade 8\nK\u20138 Standards | 53\n\n54 | K\u20138 Standards\n8\nGrade 8\nThe Number System \n8.NS\nKnow that there are numbers that are not rational, and approximate them by rational numbers.\n1.  Know that numbers that are not rational are called irrational. Understand informally that every number has a decimal  \nexpansion; for rational numbers show that the decimal expansion repeats eventually, and convert a decimal expansion \nwhich repeats eventually into a rational number. \n2.  Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the size of irrational numbers, locate them approximately on a \nnumber line diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g.,\u03c0 2). For example, by truncating the decimal expansion of  \n\u221a2, show that \u221a2 is between 1 and 2, then between 1.4 and 1.5, and explain how to continue on to get better approximations.\nExpressions and Equations \n8.EE\nWork with radicals and integer exponents.\n1.  Know and apply the properties of integer exponents to generate equivalent numerical expressions. For example,  \n32 \u00d7 3\u20135 = 3\u20133 = 1/33 = 1/27.\n2.  Use square root and cube root symbols to represent solutions to equations of the form x2 = p and x3 = p, where p is a  \npositive rational number. Evaluate square roots of small perfect squares and cube roots of small perfect cubes. Know that \n\u221a2 is irrational.\n3.  Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an integer power of 10 to estimate very large or very small  \nquantities, and to express how many times as much one is than the other. For example, estimate the population of the \nUnited States as 3 \u00d7 108 and the population of the world as 7 \u00d7 109, and determine that the world population is more  \nthan 20 times larger.\n4.  Perform operations with numbers expressed in scienti\ufb01c notation, including problems where both decimal and scienti\ufb01c \nnotation are used. Use scienti\ufb01c notation and choose units of appropriate size for measurements of very large or very small \nquantities (e.g., use millimeters per year for sea\ufb02oor spreading). Interpret scienti\ufb01c notation that has been generated by \ntechnology.\nUnderstand the connections between proportional relationships, lines, and linear equations.\n5.  Graph proportional relationships, interpreting the unit rate as the slope of the graph. Compare two different proportional \nrelationships represented in different ways. For example, compare a distance-time graph to a distance-time equation to \ndetermine which of two moving objects has greater speed.\n6.  Use similar triangles to explain why the slope m is the same between any two distinct points on a non-vertical line in the \ncoordinate plane; derive the equation y = mx for a line through the origin and the equation y = mx + b for a line intercepting \nthe vertical axis at b.\nAnalyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations.\n7. Solve linear equations in one variable.\na.  Give examples of linear equations in one variable with one solution, in\ufb01nitely many solutions, or no solutions. Show \nwhich of these possibilities is the case by successively transforming the given equation into simpler forms, until an \nequivalent equation of the form x = a, a = a, or a = b results (where a and b are different numbers).\nb.  Solve linear equations with rational number coef\ufb01cients, including equations whose solutions require expanding  \nexpressions using the distributive property and collecting like terms.\nGrade 8\n\nGrade 8 8\n8.  Analyze and solve pairs of simultaneous linear equations.\na.  Understand that solutions to a system of two linear equations in two variables correspond to points of intersection of \ntheir graphs, because points of intersection satisfy both equations simultaneously.\nb.  Solve systems of two linear equations in two variables algebraically, and estimate solutions by graphing the equations. \nSolve simple cases by inspection. For example, 3x + 2y = 5 and 3x + 2y = 6 have no solution because 3x + 2y cannot \nsimultaneously be 5 and 6.\nc.  Solve real-world and mathematical problems leading to to linear equations in two variables. For example, given  \ncoordinates for two pairs of points, determine whether the line through the \ufb01rst pair of points intersects the line through \nthe second pair.\nFunctions \n8.F\nDe\ufb01ne, evaluate, and compare functions.\n1.  Understand that a function is a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. The graph of a function is the set of \nordered pairs consisting of an input and the corresponding output.1\n2.  Compare properties of two functions each represented in a different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables,  \nor by verbal descriptions). For example, given a linear function represented by a table of values and a linear function  \nrepresented by an algebraic expression, determine which function has the greater rate of change.\n3.  Interpret the equation y = mx + b as de\ufb01ning a linear function, whose graph is a straight line; give examples of functions \nthat are not linear. For example, the function A = s2 giving the area of a square as a function of its side length is not linear \nbecause its graph contains the points (1,1), (2,4) and (3,9), which are not on a straight line.\nUse functions to model relationships between quantities.\n4.  Construct a function to model a linear relationship between two quantities. Determine the rate of change and initial value \nof the function from a description of a relationship or from two (x, y) values, including reading these from a table or from a \ngraph. Interpret the rate of change and initial value of a linear function in terms of the situation it models, and in terms of \nits graph or a table of values.\n5.  Describe qualitatively the functional relationship between two quantities by analyzing a graph (e.g., where the function is \nincreasing or decreasing, linear or nonlinear). Sketch a graph that exhibits the qualitative features of a function that has \nbeen described verbally.\nGeometry \n8.G\nUnderstand congruence and similarity using physical models, transparencies, or geometry software.\n1.  Verify experimentally the properties of rotations, re\ufb02ections, and translations:\na.  Lines are taken to lines, and line segments to line segments of the same length.\nb.  Angles are taken to angles of the same measure.\nc.  Parallel lines are taken to parallel lines.\n1. Function notation is not required in grade 8.\nGrade 8\nK\u20138 Standards  | 55\n\n8\nGrade 8\n2.  Understand that a two-dimensional \ufb01gure is congruent to another if the second can be obtained from the \ufb01rst by a sequence \nof rotations, re\ufb02ections, and translations; given two congruent \ufb01gures, describe a sequence that exhibits the congruence \nbetween them.\n3.  Describe the effect of dilations, translations, rotations, and re\ufb02ections on two-dimensional \ufb01gures using coordinates.\n4.  Understand that a two-dimensional \ufb01gure is similar to another if the second can be obtained from the \ufb01rst by a sequence \nof rotations, re\ufb02ections, translations, and dilations; given two similar two-dimensional \ufb01gures, describe a sequence that \nexhibits the similarity between them.\n5.  Use informal arguments to establish facts about the angle sum and exterior angle of triangles, about the angles created \nwhen parallel lines are cut by a transversal, and the angle-angle criterion for similarity of triangles. For example, arrange \nthree copies of the same triangle so that the sum of the three angles appears to form a line, and give an argument in  \nterms of transversals why this is so.\nUnderstand and apply the Pythagorean Theorem.\n6.  Explain a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse.\n7.  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to determine unknown side lengths in right triangles in real-world and mathematical  \nproblems in two and three dimensions.\n8.  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to \ufb01nd the distance between two points in a coordinate system.\nSolve real-world and mathematical problems involving volume of cylinders, cones, and spheres.\n9.  Know the formulas for the volumes of cones, cylinders, and spheres and use them to solve real-world and mathematical \nproblems.\nStatistics and Probability \n8.SP\nInvestigate patterns of association in bivariate data.\n1.  Construct and interpret scatter plots for bivariate measurement data to investigate patterns of association between two \nquantities. Describe patterns such as clustering, outliers, positive or negative association, linear association, and nonlinear \nassociation.\n2.  Know that straight lines are widely used to model relationships between two quantitative variables. For scatter plots that \nsuggest a linear association, informally \ufb01t a straight line, and informally assess the model \ufb01t by judging the closeness of the \ndata points to the line.\n3.  Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the context of bivariate measurement data, interpreting the slope \nand intercept. For example, in a linear model for a biology experiment, interpret a slope of 1.5 cm/hr as meaning that an \nadditional hour of sunlight each day is associated with an additional 1.5 cm in mature plant height.\n4.  Understand that patterns of association can also be seen in bivariate categorical data by displaying frequencies and relative  \nfrequencies in a two-way table. Construct and interpret a two-way table summarizing data on two categorical variables \ncollected from the same subjects. Use relative frequencies calculated for rows or columns to describe possible association \nbetween the two variables. For example, collect data from students in your class on whether or not they have a curfew on \nschool nights and whether or not they have assigned chores at home. Is there evidence that those who have a curfew also \ntend to have chores?\n56 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 8",
