  "content": "Grade 4\nIn grade 4, instructional time should focus on three critical areas: (1) developing understanding and \ufb02uency with multi-digit \nmultiplication, and developing understanding of dividing to \ufb01nd quotients involving multi-digit dividends; (2) developing an  \nunderstanding of fraction equivalence, addition and subtraction of fractions with like denominators, and multiplication of  \nfractions by whole numbers; (3) understanding that geometric \ufb01gures can be analyzed and classi\ufb01ed based on their properties, \nsuch as having parallel sides, perpendicular sides, particular angle measures, and symmetry.\n(1) Students generalize their understanding of place value to 1,000,000, understanding the relative sizes of numbers in each \nplace. They apply their understanding of models for multiplication (equal-sized groups, arrays, area models), place value, \nand properties of operations, in particular the distributive property, as they develop, discuss, and use ef\ufb01cient, accurate, \nand generalizable methods to compute products of multi-digit whole numbers. Depending on the numbers and the context, \nthey select and accurately apply appropriate methods to estimate or mentally calculate products. They develop \ufb02uency with \nef\ufb01cient procedures for multiplying whole numbers; understand and explain why the procedures work based on place value \nand properties of operations; and use them to solve problems. Students apply their understanding of models for division, \nplace value, properties of operations, and the relationship of division to multiplication as they develop, discuss, and use \nef\ufb01cient, accurate, and generalizable procedures to \ufb01nd quotients involving multi-digit dividends. They select and accurately \napply appropriate methods to estimate and mentally calculate quotients, and interpret remainders based upon the context.\n(2) Students develop understanding of fraction equivalence and operations with fractions. They recognize that two different \nfractions can be equal (e.g., 15/9 = 5/3), and they develop methods for generating and recognizing equivalent fractions. \nStudents extend previous understandings about how fractions are built from unit fractions, composing fractions from unit \nfractions, decomposing fractions into unit fractions, and using the meaning of fractions and the meaning of multiplication  \nto multiply a fraction by a whole number. \n(3) Students describe, analyze, compare, and classify two-dimensional shapes. Through building, drawing, and analyzing  \ntwo-dimensional shapes, students deepen their understanding of properties of two-dimensional objects and the use of \nthem to solve problems involving symmetry.\n28 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 4\n\n \nGrade 4 Overview\nOperations and Algebraic Thinking\n\ue001 \nUse the four operations with whole numbers to solve problems.\n\ue001 \nGain familiarity with factors and multiples.\n\ue001 \nGenerate and analyze patterns.\nNumber and Operations in Base Ten\n\ue001 \nGeneralize place value understanding for multi-digit whole  \nnumbers.\n\ue001 \nUse place value understanding and properties of operations  \nto perform multi-digit arithmetic.\nNumber and Operations\u2014Fractions\n\ue001 \nExtend understanding of fraction equivalence and ordering.\n\ue001 \nBuild fractions from unit fractions by applying and extending  \nprevious understandings of operations on whole numbers.\n\ue001 \nUnderstand decimal notation for fractions, and compare  \ndecimal fractions.\nMeasurement and Data\n\ue001 \nSolve problems involving measurement and conversion of measurements from a larger unit to a smaller unit.\n\ue001 \nRepresent and interpret data.\n\ue001\nGeometric measurement: understand concepts of angle and measure angles.\nGeometry\n\ue001 \nDraw and identify lines and angles, and classify shapes by properties of their lines and angles.\nMathematical Practices\n1.  Make sense of problems and persevere in \nsolving them.\n2.  Reason abstractly and quantitatively.\n3.  Construct viable arguments and critique the \nreasoning of others.\n4.  Model with mathematics.\n5.  Use appropriate tools strategically.\n6.  Attend to precision.\n7.  Look for and make use of structure.\n8.  Look for and express regularity in repeated \nreasoning.\nGrade 4\nK\u20138 Standards | 29\n\n30 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 4\n4\nOperations and Algebraic Thinking \n4.OA\nUse the four operations with whole numbers to solve problems.\n1.  Interpret a multiplication equation as a comparison, e.g., interpret 35 = 5 \u00d7 7 as a statement that 35 is 5 times as many as \n7 and 7 times as many as 5. Represent verbal statements of multiplicative comparisons as multiplication equations.\n2.  Multiply or divide to solve word problems involving multiplicative comparison, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a \nsymbol for the unknown number to represent the problem, distinguishing multiplicative comparison from additive comparison.1\n3.  Solve multistep word problems posed with whole numbers and having whole-number answers using the four operations, \nincluding problems in which remainders must be interpreted. Represent these problems using equations with a letter  \nstanding for the unknown quantity. Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation  \nstrategies including rounding. \nGain familiarity with factors and multiples.\n4.  Find all factor pairs for a whole number in the range 1\u2013100. Recognize that a whole number is a multiple of each of its \nfactors. Determine whether a given whole number in the range 1\u2013100 is a multiple of a given one-digit number. Determine \nwhether a given whole number in the range 1\u2013100 is prime or composite.\nGenerate and analyze patterns.\n5.  Generate a number or shape pattern that follows a given rule. Identify apparent features of the pattern that were not explicit \nin the rule itself. For example, given the rule \u201cAdd 3\u201d and the starting number 1, generate terms in the resulting sequence \nand observe that the terms appear to alternate between odd and even numbers. Explain informally why the numbers will \ncontinue to alternate in this way.\nNumber and Operations in Base Ten2 \n4.NBT\nGeneralize place value understanding for multi-digit whole numbers.\n1.  Recognize that in a multi-digit whole number, a digit in one place represents ten times what it represents in the place to its \nright. For example, recognize that 700 \u00f7 70 = 10 by applying concepts of place value and division.\n2.  Read and write multi-digit whole numbers using base-ten numerals, number names, and expanded form. Compare two multi- \ndigit numbers based on meanings of the digits in each place, using >, =, and < symbols to record the results of comparisons.\n3.  Use place value understanding to round multi-digit whole numbers to any place.\nUse place value understanding and properties of operations to perform multi-digit arithmetic.\n4.  Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.\n5.  Multiply a whole number of up to four digits by a one-digit whole number, and multiply two two-digit numbers, using \nstrategies based on place value and the properties of operations. Illustrate and explain the calculation by using equations, \nrectangular arrays, and/or area models.\n6.  Find whole-number quotients and remainders with up to four-digit dividends and one-digit divisors, using strategies based  \non place value, the properties of operations, and/or the relationship between multiplication and division. Illustrate and \nexplain the calculation by using equations, rectangular arrays, and/or area models.2 \n1. See Glossary, Table 2.\n2. Grade 4 expectations in this domain are limited to whole numbers less than or equal to 1,000,000.\nGrade 4\n\nGrade 4 4\nNumber and Operations\u2014Fractions3 \n4.NF\nExtend understanding of fraction equivalence and ordering.1\n1.  Explain why a fraction a/b is equivalent to a fraction (n \u00d7 a)/(n \u00d7 b) by using visual fraction models, with attention to how\nthe number and size of the parts differ even though the two fractions themselves are the same size. Use this principle to \nrecognize and generate equivalent fractions.\n2.  Compare two fractions with different numerators and different denominators, e.g., by creating common denominators or \nnumerators, or by comparing to a benchmark fraction such as 1/2. Recognize that comparisons are valid only when the two \nfractions refer to the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with symbols >, =, or <, and justify the conclusions, \ne.g., by using a visual fraction model.\nBuild fractions from unit fractions by applying and extending previous understandings of operations on whole \nnumbers.\n3.  Understand a fraction a/b with a > 1 as a sum of fractions 1/b.\na.  Understand addition and subtraction of fractions as joining and separating parts referring to the same whole.\nb.  Decompose a fraction into a sum of fractions with the same denominator in more than one way, recording each  \ndecomposition by an equation. Justify decompositions, e.g., by using a visual fraction model. Examples:  \n3/8 = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 ; 3/8 = 1/8 + 2/8 ; 2 1/8 = 1 + 1 + 1/8 = 8/8 + 8/8 + 1/8.\nc.  Add and subtract mixed numbers with like denominators, e.g., by replacing each mixed number with an equivalent  \nfraction, and/or by using properties of operations and the relationship between addition and subtraction.\nd.  Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions referring to the same whole and having like  \ndenominators, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem.\n4.  Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction by a whole number.\na.  Understand a fraction a/b as a multiple of 1/b. For example, use a visual fraction model to represent 5/4 as the  \nproduct 5 \u00d7 (1/4), recording the conclusion by the equation 5/4 = 5 \u00d7 (1/4).\nb.  Understand a multiple of a/b as a multiple of 1/b, and use this understanding to multiply a fraction by a whole  \nnumber. For example, use a visual fraction model to express 3 \u00d7 (2/5) as 6 \u00d7 (1/5), recognizing this product as 6/5. \n(In general, n \u00d7 (a/b) = (n \u00d7 a)/b.)\nc.  Solve word problems involving multiplication of a fraction by a whole number, e.g., by using visual fraction models and \nequations to represent the problem. For example, if each person at a party will eat 3/8 of a pound of roast beef, and \nthere will be 5 people at the party, how many pounds of roast beef will be needed? Between what two whole numbers \ndoes your answer lie?\nUnderstand decimal notation for fractions, and compare decimal fractions.\n5.  Express a fraction with denominator 10 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 100, and use this technique to add two  \nfractions with respective denominators 10 and 100.4 For example, express 3/10 as 30/100, and add 3/10 + 4/100 = 34/100.2\n6.  Use decimal notation for fractions with denominators 10 or 100. For example, rewrite 0.62 as 62/100; describe a length as \n0.62 meters; locate 0.62 on a number line diagram.\n3. Grade 4 expectations in this domain are limited to fractions with denominators 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 100.\n4. Students who can generate equivalent fractions can develop strategies for adding fractions with unlike denominators in general. But addition and  \nsubtraction with unlike denominators in general is not a requirement at this grade.\nGrade 4\nK\u20138 Standards  | 31\n\n4\nGrade 4\n7.  Compare two decimals to hundredths by reasoning about their size. Recognize that comparisons are valid only when  \nthe two decimals refer to the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with the symbols >, =, or <, and justify the  \nconclusions, e.g., by using the number line or another visual model. CA\nMeasurement and Data \n4.MD\nSolve problems involving measurement and conversion of measurements from a larger unit to a smaller unit.\n1.  Know relative sizes of measurement units within one system of units including km, m, cm; kg, g; lb, oz.; l, ml; hr, min, sec. \nWithin a single system of measurement, express measurements in a larger unit in terms of a smaller unit. Record measure-\nment equivalents in a two-column table. For example, know that 1 ft is 12 times as long as 1 in. Express the length of a 4 ft \nsnake as 48 in. Generate a conversion table for feet and inches listing the number pairs (1, 12), (2, 24), (3, 36), . . .\n2.  Use the four operations to solve word problems involving distances, intervals of time, liquid volumes, masses of objects, \nand money, including problems involving simple fractions or decimals, and problems that require expressing measurements \ngiven in a larger unit in terms of a smaller unit. Represent measurement quantities using diagrams such as number line \ndiagrams that feature a measurement scale.\n3.  Apply the area and perimeter formulas for rectangles in real-world and mathematical problems. For example, \ufb01nd the width \nof a rectangular room given the area of the \ufb02ooring and the length, by viewing the area formula as a multiplication equation \nwith an unknown factor.\nRepresent and interpret data.\n4.  Make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Solve problems involving  \naddition and subtraction of fractions by using information presented in line plots. For example, from a line plot \ufb01nd and \ninterpret the difference in length between the longest and shortest specimens in an insect collection.\nGeometric measurement: understand concepts of angle and measure angles.\n5.  Recognize angles as geometric shapes that are formed wherever two rays share a common endpoint, and understand  \nconcepts of angle measurement:\na.  An angle is measured with reference to a circle with its center at the common endpoint of the rays, by considering \nthe fraction of the circular arc between the points where the two rays intersect the circle. An angle that turns through \n1/360 of a circle is called a \u201cone-degree angle,\u201d and can be used to measure angles.\nb.  An angle that turns through n one-degree angles is said to have an angle measure of n degrees.\n6 \nMeasure angles in whole-number degrees using a protractor. Sketch angles of speci\ufb01ed measure.\n7.  Recognize angle measure as additive. When an angle is decomposed into non-overlapping parts, the angle measure of the \nwhole is the sum of the angle measures of the parts. Solve addition and subtraction problems to \ufb01nd unknown angles on a \ndiagram in real-world and mathematical problems, e.g., by using an equation with a symbol for the unknown angle measure.\n32 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 4\n\nGrade 4 4\nGeometry \n4.G\nDraw and identify lines and angles, and classify shapes by properties of their lines and angles.\n1.  Draw points, lines, line segments, rays, angles (right, acute, obtuse), and perpendicular and parallel lines. Identify these in \ntwo-dimensional \ufb01gures.\n2.  Classify two-dimensional \ufb01gures based on the presence or absence of parallel or perpendicular lines, or the presence or \nabsence of angles of a speci\ufb01ed size. Recognize right triangles as a category, and identify right triangles. (Two-dimensional \nshapes should include special triangles, e.g., equilateral, isosceles, scalene, and special quadrilaterals, e.g., rhombus, \nsquare, rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid.) CA\n3.  Recognize a line of symmetry for a two-dimensional \ufb01gure as a line across the \ufb01gure such that the \ufb01gure can be folded \nalong the line into matching parts. Identify line-symmetric \ufb01gures and draw lines of symmetry.\nGrade 4\nK\u20138 Standards  | 33",
