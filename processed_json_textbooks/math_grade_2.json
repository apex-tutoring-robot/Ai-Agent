  "content": "Grade 2\nIn grade 2, instructional time should focus on four critical areas: (1) extending understanding of base-ten notation; (2) building \n\ufb02uency with addition and subtraction; (3) using standard units of measure; and (4) describing and analyzing shapes.\n(1) Students extend their understanding of the base-ten system. This includes ideas of counting in \ufb01ves, tens, and multiples of \nhundreds, tens, and ones, as well as number relationships involving these units, including comparing. Students understand \nmulti-digit numbers (up to 1000) written in base-ten notation, recognizing that the digits in each place represent amounts \nof thousands, hundreds, tens, or ones (e.g., 853 is 8 hundreds + 5 tens + 3 ones). \n(2) Students use their understanding of addition to develop \ufb02uency with addition and subtraction within 100. They solve  \nproblems within 1000 by applying their understanding of models for addition and subtraction, and they develop, discuss, \nand use ef\ufb01cient, accurate, and generalizable methods to compute sums and differences of whole numbers in base-ten  \nnotation, using their understanding of place value and the properties of operations. They select and accurately apply  \nmethods that are appropriate for the context and the numbers involved to mentally calculate sums and differences for  \nnumbers with only tens or only hundreds. \n(3) Students recognize the need for standard units of measure (centimeter and inch) and they use rulers and other measure-\nment tools with the understanding that linear measure involves an iteration of units. They recognize that the smaller the \nunit, the more iterations they need to cover a given length. \n(4) Students describe and analyze shapes by examining their sides and angles. Students investigate, describe, and reason \nabout decomposing and combining shapes to make other shapes. Through building, drawing, and analyzing two- and three-\ndimensional shapes, students develop a foundation for understanding area, volume, congruence, similarity, and symmetry \nin later grades.\n18 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 2\n\n \nGrade 2 Overview\nOperations and Algebraic Thinking\n\ue001 \nRepresent and solve problems involving addition and  \nsubtraction.\n\ue001 \nAdd and subtract within 20.\n\ue001 \nWork with equal groups of objects to gain foundations for \nmultiplication.\nNumber and Operations in Base Ten\n\ue001 \nUnderstand place value.\n\ue001 \nUse place value understanding and properties of operations \nto add and subtract.\nMeasurement and Data\n\ue001 \nMeasure and estimate lengths in standard units.\n\ue001 \nRelate addition and subtraction to length.\n\ue001 \nWork with time and money.\n\ue001 \nRepresent and interpret data.\nGeometry\n\ue001 \nReason with shapes and their attributes.\nMathematical Practices\n1.

Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking \nfrom, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using drawings and equations \nwith a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.1\nAdd and subtract within 20.\n2.  Fluently add and subtract within 20 using mental strategies.2 By end of Grade 2, know from memory all sums of two  \none-digit numbers.\nWork with equal groups of objects to gain foundations for multiplication.\n3.  Determine whether a group of objects (up to 20) has an odd or even number of members, e.g., by pairing objects or  \ncounting them by 2s; write an equation to express an even number as a sum of two equal addends.\n4.  Use addition to \ufb01nd the total number of objects arranged in rectangular arrays with up to 5 rows and up to 5 columns;  \nwrite an equation to express the total as a sum of equal addends.\nNumber and Operations in Base Ten \n2.NBT\nUnderstand place value.\n1.  Understand that the three digits of a three-digit number represent amounts of hundreds, tens, and ones; e.g., 706 equals 7 \nhundreds, 0 tens, and 6 ones. Understand the following as special cases:\na.  100 can be thought of as a bundle of ten tens\u2014called a \u201chundred.\u201d\nb.  The numbers 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 refer to one, two, three, four, \ufb01ve, six, seven, eight, or nine \nhundreds (and 0 tens and 0 ones).\n2.  Count within 1000; skip-count by 2s, 5s, 10s, and 100s. CA\n3.  Read and write numbers to 1000 using base-ten numerals, number names, and expanded form.\n4.  Compare two three-digit numbers based on meanings of the hundreds, tens, and ones digits, using >, =, and < symbols to \nrecord the results of comparisons.\nUse place value understanding and properties of operations to add and subtract.\n5.  Fluently add and subtract within 100 using strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relation-\nship between addition and subtraction.\n6.  Add up to four two-digit numbers using strategies based on place value and properties of operations.\n7.  Add and subtract within 1000, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value, properties of  \noperations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method. Understand \nthat in adding or subtracting three-digit numbers, one adds or subtracts hundreds and hundreds, tens and tens, ones and \nones; and sometimes it is necessary to compose or decompose tens or hundreds.\n1. See Glossary, Table 1.\n2. See standard 1.OA.6 for a list of mental strategies.\n20 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 2\n\nGrade 2 2\n7.1 Use estimation strategies to make reasonable estimates in problem solving. CA\n8.  Mentally add 10 or 100 to a given number 100\u2013900, and mentally subtract 10 or 100 from a given number 100\u2013900.\n9.  Explain why addition and subtraction strategies work, using place value and the properties of operations.31\nMeasurement and Data \n2.MD\nMeasure and estimate lengths in standard units.\n1.  Measure the length of an object by selecting and using appropriate tools such as rulers, yardsticks, meter sticks, and  \nmeasuring tapes.\n2.  Measure the length of an object twice, using length units of different lengths for the two measurements; describe how the \ntwo measurements relate to the size of the unit chosen.\n3.  Estimate lengths using units of inches, feet, centimeters, and meters.\n4.  Measure to determine how much longer one object is than another, expressing the length difference in terms of a standard \nlength unit.\nRelate addition and subtraction to length.\n5.  Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve word problems involving lengths that are given in the same units, e.g., by \nusing drawings (such as drawings of rulers) and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.\n6.  Represent whole numbers as lengths from 0 on a number line diagram with equally spaced points corresponding to the \nnumbers 0, 1, 2, . . . , and represent whole-number sums and differences within 100 on a number line diagram.\nWork with time and money.\n7.  Tell and write time from analog and digital clocks to the nearest \ufb01ve minutes, using a.m. and p.m. Know relationships of \ntime (e.g., minutes in an hour, days in a month, weeks in a year). CA\n8.  Solve word problems involving dollar bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, using $ and \u00a2 symbols appropriately. \nExample: If you have 2 dimes and 3 pennies, how many cents do you have?\nRepresent and interpret data.\n9.  Generate measurement data by measuring lengths of several objects to the nearest whole unit, or by making repeated \nmeasurements of the same object. Show the measurements by making a line plot, where the horizontal scale is marked off \nin whole-number units.\n10.  Draw a picture graph and a bar graph (with single-unit scale) to represent a data set with up to four categories. Solve \nsimple put-together, take-apart, and compare problems4 using information presented in a bar graph.\n3. Explanations may be supported by drawings or objects.\n4. See Glossary, Table 1.\nGrade 2\nK\u20138 Standards  | 21\n\n2\nGrade 2\nGeometry \n2.G\nReason with shapes and their attributes.\n1.  Recognize and draw shapes having speci\ufb01ed attributes, such as a given number of angles or a given number of equal \nfaces.5 Identify triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and cubes.\n2.  Partition a rectangle into rows and columns of same-size squares and count to \ufb01nd the total number of them.\n3.  Partition circles and rectangles into two, three, or four equal shares, describe the shares using the words halves, thirds, half \nof, a third of, etc., and describe the whole as two halves, three thirds, four fourths. Recognize that equal shares of identical \nwholes need not have the same shape.\n2 \n5. Sizes are compared directly or visually, not compared by measuring. \n22 | K\u20138 Standards\nGrade 2",
